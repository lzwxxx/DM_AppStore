Technology improving and enhancing lives 

New applications constantly being developed

Aiming to producing insightful information to help gain market share

### Problem Statement

Only 1 consumer application out of 100 developed is successful. How can we improve the likelihood that applications will succeed?

According to statistics, only 0.5% of customer applications succeed, or 99.5% of them fail. These days, consumer applications can fail in a single day.

According to data provided by LinkedIn on Google Play store applications, 68% of all apps ever released never hit the 1000 downloads.
